Part 4 of this JavaFX Tutorial.

In this video we want to get access to the Items in our ListView
and display them in a Popup.

This was not very difficult.. writing english while listening to german music is more difficult ;)

Lets add a ContextMenu on this ListView and then stop the video..

Okay, sorry for this little mistake, maybe so you'll learn to do nothing stupid ;)

Tnx for watching.
