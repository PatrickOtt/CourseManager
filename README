Welcome to the second part of this JavaFX Tutorial.

In the first part we add what to do when a button was clicked
programmaitically, but now we want to link the method which
should be invoked, when the button is clicked in our
design phase in scene builder.

We write a new method in our MainController.


Okay, this is the second method i spoke in the first video..

So this should be all for now and today, i hope it will help someone.
